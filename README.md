# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Athletix — A Fitness Intelligence Technology

Athletix is an AI-powered fitness companion that bridges the gap between technology and human trainers by delivering personalized workouts, culturally and medically adaptive diet plans, and real-time biomechanics-aware form analysis.  
It provides an intelligent, cost-effective, and accessible fitness experience for everyone — anytime, anywhere.

---

## Motivation
Traditional fitness solutions either rely on costly personal trainers or generic apps that fail to adapt to individual needs.  
Athletix introduces a Virtual AI Trainer that learns from users over time — understanding their goals, limitations, and preferences — creating a truly personalized fitness journey through the integration of AI, ML, and Computer Vision.

---

## Key Features
- **Virtual AI Trainer (Knowledge Hub)**  
  Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuned LLMs.  
  Answers fitness, nutrition, and recovery queries safely and accurately.  

- **Real-Time Form Analysis**  
  Uses HRNet for pose estimation and biomechanics-aware feedback.  
  Detects incorrect form to prevent injuries and improve effectiveness.  

- **Adaptive Diet Planning**  
  Generates diet plans using ML-based macro balancing and constraint optimization.  
  Supports cultural and medical restrictions (Halal, Vegan, Keto, Diabetic).  

- **Reinforcement Learning Adaptation**  
  Continuously adjusts workouts and diets based on user progress, preferences, and feedback.  

- **Progress & Tracking Dashboard**  
  Tracks calories, workouts, adherence, and progress visually for long-term motivation.  

---

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|--------|-------------|
| Frontend | React Native (Cross-Platform Mobile App) |
| Backend | FastAPI + PostgreSQL + FAISS (Vector DB for RAG) |
| AI Modules | TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers |
| CV Model | HRNet for Pose Estimation & Form Analysis |
| ML / RL | Contextual Bandits + Constraint-Based Optimizer |
| Other Tools | MediaPipe, OpenCV, Python |

---

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
Athletix supports the United Nations SDGs by:
- **SDG 3:** Good Health & Well-being — promoting fitness, injury prevention, and healthy lifestyles.  
- **SDG 9:** Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure — fostering innovation through AI-driven fitness solutions.  
- **SDG 10:** Reduced Inequalities — offering culturally inclusive and affordable fitness guidance globally.  

---

## Impact
- Bridges the gap between human coaching and AI through intelligent personalization.  
- Accessible alternative to expensive trainers — fitness for everyone.  
- Culturally inclusive approach ensures global adaptability.  
- Scalable and sustainable — deployable across mobile platforms.
